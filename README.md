# Machine Learning Web Application Made with Streamlit" 

Requirements:
*  Streamlit
*  Scikit-learn
*   Matplotlib

## Descriptions
It is a web application that created with the help of Streamlit libraries. Streamlit is the fastest way to build
and share data apps. Streamlit turns data scripts into shareable web apps in minutes. To learn more visit their
official https://streamlit.io/   websites.

In our projects, we apply different types of Machine learning classifier into different types of dataset and 
shows their accuracy score to prediction via this web app. The parameter of different classifier can be selected manually from the 
sidebar of our application then it will automatically changes the prediction score according to parameter value.

For classifier, you can select :
*  KNN
*  SVM
*  Random Forest 

and For dataset, you can select :
*   Wine
*   Iris
*   Breast Cancer

Additionally, you have options to choose different type of parameter value from the sidebar by using streamlit slider features.
